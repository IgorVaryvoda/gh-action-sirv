# Upload to Sirv
An action that allows you to upload a specific folder's content to Sirv <a href="https://sirv.com/">image CDN</a>.

## Workflow example
Here's an example of how to automatically upload images to Sirv from a folder.
- Create a `.github/workflows/sirv-upload.yml` file:
```yaml
name: Sirv uploader
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: main
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: sirv/gh-action-sirv@main
        name: Upload to Sirv
        id: Sirv
        with:
          clientId: ${{ secrets.clientId }}
          clientSecret: ${{ secrets.clientSecret}}
          source_dir: 'upload'
          output_dir: 'upload'
```
- Create a Sirv API client. You can do this in your [Sirv account settings](https://my.sirv.com/#/account/settings/api).
- Add `clientId` and `clientSecret` ENV variables in your repo settings.
